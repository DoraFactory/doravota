# Dora Vota
The Dora Vota mainnet is an appchain built exclusively for the Dora community, supporting essential applications such as quadratic voting and MACI (Minimal Anti-collusion Infrastructure) for voting, public good funding, and governance.

## System Requirements
This system spec has been tested by many users and validators and found to be comfortable:

- support AMD, ARM, Apple M1 and M2, At least 8 cores
- 64GB RAM (A lot can be in swap)
- 1TB NVMe Storage
- 100MBPS bidirectional internet connection

You can run Dora Vota Node on lower-spec hardware for each component, but you may find that it is not highly performant or prone to crashing.
